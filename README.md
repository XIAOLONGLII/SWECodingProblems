### Problem #1

```
Description
Publish a service on the web with two endpoints:
1. /messages takes a message (a string) as a POST and returns the SHA256 hash digest of
that message (in hexadecimal format)
2. /messages/<hash> is a GET request that returns the original message. A request to a
non-existent<hash> should return a 404 error.
```



### Problem #2

Description
You have been given a gift card that is about to expire and you want to buy gifts for 2 friends.
You want to spend the whole gift card, or if thatâ€™s not an option as close to the balance as
possible. You have a list of sorted prices for a popular store that you know they both like to
shop at. Your challenge is to find two distinct items in the list whose sum is minimally under (or
equal to) the gift card balance.
